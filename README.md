## Project Title

University Ratings Proposal

## Description
Worked in a team to extract, clean, and restructure 1,900+ raw observations into 150 composite ratings using Excel and RAND()-based sampling. Conducted numeric and categorical descriptive analysis to detect outliers and skewness, followed by correlation matrix analysis to assess inter-variable relationships. Research showed a strong positive correlation (r = 0.90) with overall rating. Applied backward stepwise multiple regression to identify significant predictors, resulting in a final model where Research, Teaching, and Engagement explained 86% of the variance. Validated model assumptions using residual analysis and VIF diagnostics, confirming no severe multicollinearity (VIF < 5).
